Description: Implementation of the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) in R. MPA is a
    nature-inspired optimization algorithm that follows the rules governing optimal
    foraging strategy and encounter rate policy between predator and prey in marine
    ecosystems. Based on the paper by Faramarzi et al. (2020)
