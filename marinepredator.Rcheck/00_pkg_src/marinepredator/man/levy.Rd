\title{Levy Flight Random Step Generator}
\usage{
levy(n, m, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of rows (typically the number of search agents).}

\item{m}{Number of columns (typically the number of dimensions).}

\item{beta}{Power law exponent controlling the tail heaviness of the
distribution. Must satisfy \code{1 < beta < 2}. Lower values produce
heavier tails (more frequent long jumps). The value 1.5 is commonly used.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \code{n x m} containing Levy flight
  step values. Each element represents a random step drawn from the Levy
  distribution.
}
\description{
Generates Levy flight random steps for optimization algorithms.
Levy flight is characterized by a heavy-tailed power-law distribution and is
used to model the movement patterns of marine predators, allowing for
occasional long jumps that help escape local optima.
}
\details{
The Levy flight step is computed using Mantegna's algorithm:

\deqn{L = u / |v|^{1/\beta}}

where \eqn{u \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)} and \eqn{v \sim N(0, 1)}, with:

\deqn{\sigma_u = \left( \frac{\Gamma(1+\beta) \cdot \sin(\pi \beta / 2)}
  {\Gamma((1+\beta)/2) \cdot \beta \cdot 2^{(\beta-1)/2}} \right)^{1/\beta}}

Levy flights are used in MPA during Phase 2 (for half the population) and
Phase 3 (for all agents) to balance exploration and exploitation.

\examples{
# Generate 10 Levy flight steps in 2 dimensions with beta = 1.5
steps <- levy(10, 2, 1.5)
dim(steps)  # 10 x 2

# Visualize the distribution of Levy steps
steps_1d <- levy(1000, 1, 1.5)
hist(steps_1d, breaks = 50, main = "Levy Flight Distribution")
